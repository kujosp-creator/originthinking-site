      <h2>The broken loop problem</h2>
      <p>Many teams are told to run daily huddles and use visual boards. The loop still breaks.</p>
      <ul class="pl-list">
        <li>Huddles drift into status updates instead of decisions and next moves.</li>
        <li>Boards become wallpaper that no one really uses.</li>
        <li>Problems are logged but not actually worked to conclusion.</li>
        <li>Ideas are generated but nothing ever sticks.</li>
      </ul>
      <div class="pl-callout">
        PROVE Loop™ exists to fix that broken loop. It keeps real gaps, real experiments, and real leadership behavior in front of people every day at Tier 1 and Tier 2.

    <section class="pl-section" id="four-part-system">
      <h2>How PROVE Loop™ fits the Origin system</h2>
      <p>Origin Thinking™ is a complete operating system for practical problem solving and daily management. It has four connected parts that work together so improvements do not fade.</p>

      <div class="grid-4">
        <article class="card">
          <h3>Origin Problem Solving™</h3>
          <p>The method teams use to understand and close important gaps.</p>

          <h3>PROVE Loop™</h3>
          <p>The sustain engine that keeps all of it alive in daily work and shows when the system is drifting.</p>
        </article>
      </div>
      <p style="margin-top:32px">
        A gap shows up in the work. The team uses Origin Problem Solving™ and OPS Tools™ to understand it. Leaders use the Origin Leadership Focus Deck™ in private one to ones to pick a behavior to strengthen. PROVE Loop™ keeps the gap, the working standard, and the leadership focus visible in the Tier 1 and Tier 2 rhythm until the work is stable and the gains are held.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="pl-section" id="what-it-is">
      <h2>What PROVE Loop™ looks like in practice</h2>
      <p>PROVE Loop™ is not a single board or script. It is a simple pattern that ties your Tier 1 and Tier 2 routines together so improvements do not fade away.</p>

      <div class="grid-2">
        <div>
          <h3>Tier 1: Front line huddle</h3>
          <p>At Tier 1, PROVE Loop™ gives each team a fast, disciplined huddle around a simple board.</p>
          <ul class="pl-list">
            <li>A Tier 1 board that shows today's context, a few key measures, and the active work to close important gaps.</li>
            <li>A small number of clear metrics that matter for the team, with visible targets and current results.</li>
            <li>A short, repeatable huddle routine that walks safety, plan versus actual, gaps, and needed support.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The point is not a fancy board. The point is a consistent rhythm where real gaps are visible and owned by the people who do the work.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3>Tier 2: Help chain</h3>
          <p>At Tier 2, PROVE Loop™ shifts the focus to support and escalation.</p>
          <ul class="pl-list">
            <li>A help chain board that shows which Tier 1 issues need support.</li>
            <li>Simple rules for when and how problems move up from Tier 1 to Tier 2.</li>
            <li>A short review that removes obstacles instead of assigning blame or rehashing status.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Tier 2 does not replace problem solving. It protects it. Leaders remove barriers, align support, and make sure the right experiments are moving forward.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
    </section>

    <section class="pl-section" id="example">
      <h2>One simple example</h2>
      <p>A field crew keeps missing first job start times. The target is wheels rolling by 7:30, but most days they launch closer to 8:30 with rushed starts and finger pointing about traffic, the schedule, or how it has always been.</p>
      <p>At Tier 1, the supervisor and crew own the problem. The middle manager makes sure time is protected in the schedule and expects the supervisor to use that time for problem solving, not firefighting. At the Tier 1 board, the crew and supervisor use OPS Tools™ to map their real morning flow from dispatch to truck to site. They mark where they wait or redo work and write a simple launch standard together. On time departure by 7:30 becomes the Tier 1 result that PROVE Loop™ will track.</p>
      <p>Each day they run PROVE Loop™ on that result. They mark yesterday's departure time, call out any miss in plain language, and pick one concrete next move they control to experiment with or resolve. Repeating obstacles outside the crew's control go to Tier 2 using the help chain rules. There the middle manager works on dispatch rules, yard layout, and other system constraints. In the background, the middle manager also uses the supervisor's 90 day leadership focus from the Origin Leadership Focus Deck™ as a lens for coaching. They watch how that behavior shows up in these daily interactions, not only in a quarterly review.</p>
      <div class="pl-callout">
        Over the next few weeks the board shows fewer red marks, more days on target, and a cleaner, shared standard for how mornings start. The crew can see that they helped design the new way of working. The middle manager can see real gains in the work itself, not guessed from a report.

    <section class="pl-section" id="how-to-use">
      <h2>How you can use PROVE Loop™ today</h2>

      <div class="grid-4">
        <article class="card">
          <h3>Option 1: Start with the basics</h3>
          <p>Read the Origin Problem Solving™ book. Use OPS Tools™ to shape and clarify your key measures. Bring the Origin Leadership Focus Deck™ into your one to ones so leadership growth stays tied to real work. This will strengthen your existing boards and huddles even before you install the full PROVE Loop™ system.</p>
        </article>

        <article class="card">
          <h3>Option 2: Virtual snapshot</h3>
          <p>If you want a focused look at your current boards, huddles, and leadership routines, you can use a short virtual snapshot to see where your loop is strong and where it breaks. Availability is limited and only offered when timing and fit line up.</p>
          <a href="/system/" class="cta-link">Request snapshot &rarr;</a>
        </article>

        <article class="card">
          <h3>Option 3: Future install</h3>
          <p>Full PROVE Loop™ installations will stay limited and future focused. You can join an interest list so that if timing and capacity line up, you already have a place in line.</p>
          <a href="/#newsletter" class="cta-link">Join interest list &rarr;</a>
        </article>

        <article class="card">
          <h3>Option 4: Learn and adapt</h3>
          <p>You can also use PROVE Loop™ as a lens on your current system. Ask a simple question at your existing huddles: which gaps are visible on the wall, which experiments are active, and what leadership behavior is showing up. Use the answers to decide whether to stay with what you have or to move toward the full Origin Thinking™ system.</p>
