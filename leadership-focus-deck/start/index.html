<h2>1. Purpose</h2>
<p>The OPS Leadership Focus Deck™ turns leadership expectations into observable behaviors you can discuss, practice, and improve. It is designed for supervisors, managers, superintendents, directors, and anyone leading people or cross-functional work.</p>
</section>
<section class="panel" id="sec-2-what-success-looks-like">
<h2>2. What Success Looks Like</h2>
<p>The selected focus shows up in real situations at least weekly.</p>
<p>The leader and employee can describe specific examples (not general opinions).</p>
<p>Actions are small enough to repeat, but strong enough to change outcomes.</p>
<p>Progress is tracked with simple signals, not scores.</p>
<p>After 90 days, the behavior is stronger and the work is easier to run.</p>
</section>
<section class="panel" id="sec-3-roles-and-active-participation">
<h2>3. Roles and Active Participation</h2>
<p>This tool works when both people are active. The leader’s job is not to grade. The leader’s job is to create clarity, remove fear, and coach practice.</p>
</section>
<section class="panel" id="sec-4-run-the-card-sort-30-60-minutes-">
<h2>4. Run the Card Sort (30–60 Minutes)</h2>
<h3>4.1 Step-by-step</h3>
<p>Set the tone (2–3 minutes).</p>
<p>Employee sorts the 15 cards into three rows (8–10 minutes).</p>
<p>Walk the layout and discuss examples (15–25 minutes).</p>
<p>Choose one focus card for the next 90 days (5–10 minutes).</p>
<p>Draft a simple 90-day plan and schedule weekly check-ins (5–10 minutes).</p>
<h3>4.2 What to say (Leader scripts)</h3>
<ul>
<li>Use your own voice. The goal is clarity and safety, not perfect wording.</li>
<li>Opening: “This is for development. We are choosing one behavior to practice for the next 90 days. It is not a score.”</li>
<li>During the walk: “Tell me about a recent time this showed up.”</li>
</ul>
<p>When a card feels ‘too strong’: “What does it look like on your toughest days, not your best days?”</p>
<p>When selecting focus: “Which behavior will help the work most in the next 90 days?”</p>
<p>Closing: “We will keep this simple: one goal, one or two weekly actions, a few signals, and a short weekly check-in.”</p>
<h3>4.3 Sorting instructions (Employee)</h3>
<ul>
<li>Top row: Very much like me.</li>
<li>Middle row: Sometimes like me.</li>
<li>Bottom row: Rarely like me.</li>
<li>Within each row, rank left to right from stronger to weaker based on the last 3–6 months.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section class="panel" id="sec-5-choosing-the-90-day-focus">
<h2>5. Choosing the 90-Day Focus</h2>
<ul>
<li>Primary rule: choose the behavior most important to current business priorities (safety, quality, reliability, cost, flow, team health).</li>
<li>Override rule: if any bottom-row card touches safety, ethics, compliance, or critical reliability, it becomes the first priority.</li>
<li>If stuck: choose between two cards by selecting the one with more real practice opportunities in the next 90 days.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section class="panel" id="sec-6-the-90-day-practice-plan">
<h2>6. The 90-Day Practice Plan</h2>
<p>Most leadership tools fail because good intentions do not turn into repeated behavior. A 90-day plan succeeds when it is small, scheduled, and reinforced weekly.</p>
<h3>6.1 90-day plan template</h3>
<p>Copy and fill this in during your session.</p>
<h3>6.2 Weekly check-in (10 minutes)</h3>
<p>What did you practice since last time?</p>
<p>What happened when you practiced it?</p>
<p>What got in the way?</p>
<p>What will you adjust this week?</p>
<p>What support do you need from me?</p>

<h2>7. Common Failure Points and How to Prevent Them</h2>
<p>Use this section to keep the deck practical. These are the most common breakdowns and simple countermeasures.</p>
</section>
<section class="panel" id="sec-8-90-day-practice-examples-by-role-">
<h2>8. 90-Day Practice Examples (by role)</h2>
<p>Use these to envision what practice looks like. Keep actions small, scheduled, and visible.</p>
<h3>8.1 Supervisor example</h3>
<ul>
<li>Focus card: Create Conditions for Problem Solving</li>
<li>Behavior goal: Protect time weekly so one recurring issue is solved, not managed.</li>
<li>Weekly actions: Block 45 minutes weekly for one problem; remove one low-value task to free capacity.</li>
<li>Signals: One problem advances weekly; team can name the problem and next step.</li>
<li>Leader support: Protect the time and remove one recurring interruption.</li>
</ul>
<h3>8.2 Manager example</h3>
<ul>
<li>Focus card: Align Across Boundaries</li>
<li>Behavior goal: Reduce rework caused by unclear handoffs.</li>
<li>Weekly actions: Weekly 20-minute handoff check with partner team; define and review one shared measure.</li>
<li>Signals: Reduced rework; fewer escalations due to missing information.</li>
<li>Leader support: Align priorities with the partner manager and resolve conflicts quickly.</li>
</ul>
<h3>8.3 Director / superintendent example</h3>
<ul>
<li>Focus card: Keep Your Commitments</li>
<li>Behavior goal: Build trust through visible follow-through.</li>
<li>Weekly actions: Maintain a visible commitments list; communicate early when commitments change.</li>
<li>Signals: Fewer repeat asks; direct reports report clearer status and next steps.</li>
<li>Leader support: Protect time to close loops and model the behavior publicly.</li>
</ul>
